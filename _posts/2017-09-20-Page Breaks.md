## Auto Page Break

Sometimes you may want to export to a PDF, and have page breaks on top-level headers.

Open the themes folder, and edit the css for whatever them you want to include

```css
@media print {
  h1 {
    page-break-before: always;
  }
  h1:first-of-type {
    page-break-before: avoid;
  }
}
```

Now when exporting, a new page will be created before each h1 element, except the first one.

## Force Page Break

To insert a force page break on a document, you could try input HTML `<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>` when writing.
