Typora supports you to export current document into PDF, HTML, HTML (without styles) and Image format. More formats (like Word, RTF, etc) are supported via [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), after you [install Pandoc](https://support.typora.io/Install-and-Use-Pandoc/), those format are supported out-of-box.

You could access export command from `File` → `Export` command from menubar:

## File Format

### HTML

You can select `Export` →  `HTML` from the preferences panel to config export options for HTML file. 

![Screen Shot 2021-01-31 at 15.41.09](/media/export/Screen Shot 2021-01-31 at 15.41.09.png)

If you want to export a HTML without styles, you should choose `Export `→ `HTML (without styles)`, you will get a clean HTML file so you can add your own styles.

#### Outline

You can include outline in exported HTML by enable this option in `Export` →  `HTML` from preferences panel. Whether it is collapsible outline or flat outline depends on your current setting. You can switch them under `View` menu or under `appearance` section in preferences panel.

#### Add Custom Contents

You can add custom contents in `Append in <head />` and `Append in <body />`, which will be inserted into `<head />` part and `<body />` part in the exported html. Variables like `${title}` or `${author}` in `<title>` and `<meta>` tag will be replaced by corresponding [variables](#variables) defined in [YAML Front Matter][yml].

For example, you can insert additional `<meta>` data or custom `<style>` into exported html using those options.

##### Append Contents per Document.

You could avoid global configurations for HTML export, by one of following ways:

- Add a new export item for HTML format.
- Add configurations in [YAML Front Matter][yml].

You could use `append-head` and `append-body` in [YAML Front Matter][yml] to overwrite global settings, and / or add `append-head-extra` and `append-body-extra` to append *extra* content besides contents configured in the preferences panel.

#### Example: Export using [VLOOK](https://github.com/MadMaxChow/VLOOK)

For example, you could using look to export more fancy HTML file. You could config one such option by

1. Adding a new export command for HTML format.
2. Copy content from https://github.com/MadMaxChow/VLOOK/blob/master/released/VLOOK-plugin.txt to `Append in <body />` part.
3. Install VLook themes under https://github.com/MadMaxChow/VLOOK/tree/master/released/theme.
4. Select a VLook theme and make file based on template (https://github.com/MadMaxChow/VLOOK/blob/master/released/VLOOK-Document-Template.md) 
5. Export using the export command created in step 1 from `Export` menu.

#### More HTML Options

You could use more options, like setting up html templates, export to slides, etc by adding [new export command based on Pandoc](#other-formats-using-pandoc). 

### HTML (without styles)

You could export plain HTML (without styles) using export command `Export` → `HTML (without styles)` from menu bar.

You could add your own css styles, contents, or javascript by configuring `Append in <head />` and `Append in <body />` in preference panel. The settings are same with [add custom contents in HTML](#add-custom-contents).

### Image

#### Width and Font Size

Typora provides image export option for feeds in social media, so by default is 640px width with 24px font size. But you can change this in preferences panel.

Also, based on the purpose of this feature, overal performance, and the final size of output images, if the output article is too long, the image export would fail.

### PDF

You can select `Export` →  `PDF` from the preferences panel to config export options for PDF file, it provide options like:

#### Paper Size

Set **paper size** (A4, A5, etc) or **custom size**, and **page margins**.

Note: on Windows/Linux

```css
@media print {
  @page {
  	margin: 27mm 16mm 27mm 16mm; 
	}
}
```

Will be respected when “*Margin*” is set to default (But please unset margin for `#write` or `body` which may also affect the final output), on macOS, they are ignored.

#### Page Break

When "***Page Break Between Top Headings***” is enabled, page break will be inserted between sections divided by top level headings (`h1`), also, page break will be inserted before footnote definitions.

**Note:** You can input `<div style="page-break-after:always" />` in your document to **manually add a page break** at that position.

#### Header / Footer 

You can add custom header and footer exported PDF. For example, you can set `${title} - ${author}` as header and `No. ${pageNo} / ${pageCount}` as footer, the exported PDF is like:

<img src="/media/export/Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 00.07.01.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-01-20 at 00.07.01" style="zoom:50%;" />

You can [download the sample PDF here](/media/export/Markdown-Reference.pdf).

**Note:** Please leave enough margin when you want to append page header or footer.

**Note:** You can also set per-document headers / footers using [YAML Front Matter][yaml], for example:

```markdown
---
header: 
footer: Written in Typora
---
```

For md file contains above YAML Font Matter, header will be empty and footer will be “Written in Typora” in exported PDF file.

#### PDF Metadata

You can add metadata to exported PDF file via [YAML Front Matter][yaml], supported PDF metadata are like following example:

```gfm
---
title: Export in Typora
author: John Snow
creator: Typora inc.
subject: Tutorial
keywords: [Pandoc, Tutorial, Export]
---
```

**Note:** when “keywords” is absent, typora will also use “tags”, and you can use list with same space indent in YAML to represent an array, for instance:

```gfm
---
tags:
    - Pandoc
    - Tutorial
    - Export
---
```

### PDF (LaTeX / Pandoc)

Typora also supports you to generate PDF file using Pandoc and LaTeX (or other engines). By default, there is no such option in export menu, but you can add this by

1. Open `Export` section in preferences panel.
2. Click “Add” button on the export item list, select “PDF (LaTeX / Pandoc)” from template selector, and click “OK”.

#### PDF Engine

Pandoc provides serval engines for producing PDF file, including pdflatex, lualatex, xelatex, latexmk, tectonic, wkhtmltopdf, weasyprint, prince, context, and pdfroff. You will need to install one of those engines, and add it to your PATH, or specify the full path of the engine. You can config this in preferences panel. 

Please refer to https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--pdf-engine for detail.

**Note:** On macOS, you could install [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/), open `/Applications/TeX/Docs and Spell Utilities/Documents/What Is Installed.pdf` to check where binaries are installed to. On Intel macOS, the path for `pdflatex` after installing MacTeX-2020 might be `/usr/local/texlive/2020/bin/x86_64-darwin/pdftex`.

#### Template

You could also specify template option in preferences panel, for detailed explanations, please refer to [pandoc manual](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates).

#### Meta Data (Other Options)<span id="latex-pdf-meta"></span>

You could add meta data or extra options in [YAML Front Matter][yaml], please check https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables-for-latex for details, it support extra options including margins, paper size, font family, etc.

For example, if your select LaTeX as PDF engine, you can add footer and header via

```markdown
---
header-includes: |
    \usepackage{fancyhdr}
    \pagestyle{fancy}
    \fancyhead[CO,CE]{This is fancy}
    \fancyfoot[CO,CE]{So is this}
    \fancyfoot[LE,RO]{\thepage}
---
```

#### Extra Arguments

You could append extra command line arguments for pandoc, for which arguments you could use, please refer https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html.

### Word (.docx)

You can export to word file via `Export` → `Word (.docx)` from menu bar. You can config it from  `Export` → `Word (.docx)` in preferences panel.

#### Style Reference

For example, you can download [this sample reference doc file](/media/export/twocolumns.docx), then select this file in preferences panel for option “Style Reference”. 

To create your down style template for docx output, you can [download and modify styles for this docx file](/media/export/custom-reference.docx).

You can read more details [here](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--reference-doc).

### OpenOffice (.odt)

You can export to OpenOffice file via `Export` → `OpenOffice` from menu bar. You can config it from  `Export` → `OpenOffice` in preferences panel.

#### Template

You could find details on [pandoc manual](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates), you could download the sample template [default.opendocument](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/blob/master/default.opendocument) from https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates.

### RTF

RTF (Rich Text Format) is the format saved by TextEdit.app or WordPad.exe. You can export to RTF file via `Export` → `RTF` from menu bar. You can config it from  `Export` → `RTF` in preferences panel.

### Epub

You can export to RTF file via `Export` → `Epub` from menu bar. You can config it from  `Export` → `Epub` in preferences panel.

#### Custom CSS

You can set custom css from preferences panel, if you don’t know how to start with, you could check https://github.com/mattharrison/epub-css-starter-kit to make your own css style.

#### Chapter Level

Specify the heading level at which to split the EPUB into separate “chapter” files. The default is to split into chapters at level-1 headings. This option only affects the internal composition of the EPUB, not the way chapters and sections are displayed to users. Some readers may be slow if the chapter files are too large, so for large documents with few level-1 headings, one might want to use a chapter level of 2 or 3.

#### Cover Image

If you want to define a cover image fore pub output, please add a `cover-image: ${path}` in [YAML Front Matter][yml]. If it starts with `./` typora will convert to absolute path relative to current md file, or else, it should be absolute path, or pandoc will try to find one in its [data-dir](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--data-dir).

#### Meta Data

You can use [YAML Front Matter][yaml] to set meat data on the output epub file, for example:

```markdown
---
title: My Book
subtitle: An investigation of metadata
creator: Sarah Jones
identifier: doi:10.234234.234/33
publisher:  My Press
rights: © 2007 John Smith, CC BY-NC
ibooks:
  version: 1.3.4
---
```

You could find [more detail here](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#epub-metadata). 

### LaTeX

#### Meta Data (Other Options)

Same as[ Meta Data for PDF (LaTeX / Pandoc)](#latex-pdf-meta),  you could add meta data or extra options in [YAML Front Matter][yaml]. Please check https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables-for-latex.

##### Add Extra Content in LaTeX Header

You can use `header-includes` or `latex_header` or `latex_header_extra` in [YAML Front Matter](yaml).

For example:

```markdown
---
latex_header: |
    \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} 
    \usepackage[italian]{babel}
    \author{The Author}
    \date{2016}
    \title{The Title}
    \editor{The Editor}
classoption:
- twocolumn
- landscape
---
```

#### Wiki

#### Media Wiki

You can export to OpenOffice file via `Export` → `Media Wiki` from menu bar. You can config it from  `Export` → `Media Wiki` in preferences panel.

#### Other Wiki Format

//TODO:

### reStructuredText (RST, ReST, or reST)

You can export to OpenOffice file via `Export` → `reStructuredText` from menu bar. You can config it from  `Export` → `reStructuredText` in preferences panel.

### Textile

You can export to OpenOffice file via `Export` → `Textile` from menu bar. You can config it from  `Export` → `Textile` in preferences panel.

### OPML

You can export to OpenOffice file via `Export` → `OPML` from menu bar. You can config it from  `Export` → `OPML` in preferences panel.

### Other Formats Using Pandoc

If you want to export current document to a format that pandoc supports but not included in Typora’s export menu, you could config one such option in preferences panel.

Following is an example of providing reveals export option based on customized pandoc export option: 

<img src="/media/export/Screen Shot 2021-02-01 at 22.29.43.png" alt="pandoc-example" style="zoom:50%;" />

To start with, please add one export command choosing the “Pandoc” template, then add configurations based on your demand.

#### Target Format

You can leave this field empty, then pandoc will convert your document based on the exported filename. For example, if you export to `MyName.docx`, when pandoc will export the document to Word format automatically.

You could also specify a format, for possible options, please refer https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--to.

#### Target File Extension

When export, typora will pop up a save panel asking where to save the exported file. So please use this setting to set preferred file extensions, and please leave it empty when no preferred file extensions is required. You can set whitespace as separator, for example:

```
.latex .tex
```

#### Raw Type

For syntax that pandoc does not support natively, typora may use raw type as workaround. 

For example, the native data model in pandoc cannot represent `[toc]`, since there’s no block type TOC in pandoc. In this case, if you set raw type as media wiki, typora will use `__TOC__` syntax when export, if set raw type as latex, typora will use `\\tableofcontents`, etc. 

Usually the raw type and target format should be same, and for html-based formats, like markdown, revealjs, etc. 

And please note that the “Export” function cannot export all styles even when raw type is set.

#### Extra Arguments

You can append extra arguments to the pandoc command line using this option. For which parameters you can use, you could check https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html. For words like `${value}`, they will be replaced to [variables](#variables) defined in YAML front matter.

#### Error Shooting

When export failed, the error dialog will show the pandoc command line parameters and error message. You can copy the parameters, replace “-f native" with the markdown file path, and then input them in CMD (command line) or Terminal to test without Typora. 

##### Get Exported AST

To ensure the parse rule is same in Typora’s markdown and the output by pandoc. Typora will first convert into pandoc AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) saving in `native` format (see native under https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#option--from), then export to target format. You can get the native file by selecting “native” as target format in one custom pandoc export option.

### Other Formats Using Custom Commands

<img src="/media/export/Screen Shot 2021-02-03 at 23.48.52.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-02-03 at 23.48.52" style="zoom:50%;" />

You can also add export options based on command line commands. You will need to config:

#### Command

The command you want to trigger for this export option. For example, to submit current file to git server, you can use `git add "${currentPath}" && git commit -m "save" && git push`. The `${variable}` in this option will be replaced by [variables](#variables) defined in YAML front matter.

The command will be exported at the location of the folder of current file.

#### Show Save File Dialog

You can change this setting to tell typora if it needs to pop up a save file dialog, or pop up a folder select dialog, or no output path is required. 

#### Target File Extensions

When `Select file path to save` is selected in “Show Save File Dialog”, you can use this filed to identify which file extensions are allowed for exported file target.

#### Show Command Output after Export

Besides the `Open exported file location` and `Open exported file location`, for export option based on custom commands, typora also provides a `Show command output` option. When enabled, typora will display dialog contains the command output (from `stdout`). Even it is not enabled, when export failed, the error message from command line will always be shown.

## Appendix

### Variables

You can use `${variables}` in custom header / footer text and custom export command, their values are:

| Key                              | Value                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `${outputPath}`                  | Output file path after export. For example, if you export to location `/User/aaa/Documents/test.pdf`, then `${outputPath}` will be replaced to that path. |
| `${outputFileName}`              | File name (without extension) of the saved exported file. It will be `test` in above case. |
| `${outputFileName}`              | File name (with extension) of the saved exported file. It will be `test.md` in above case. |
| `${currentPath}`                 | Path of currently edited file. For example, if you are editing `/User/aaa/Document/readme.md`, then the value will be `/User/aaa/Document/readme.md`. |
| `${currentFileName}`             | Filename without extension of currently edited file. It will be `readme` in above case. |
| `${currentFileName}`             | Filename with extension of currently edited file. It will be `readme.md` in above case. |
| `${today}`                       | Current date, for example: `2020-01-19`                      |
| `${pageNo}`                      | Current page number. Only available for PDF format.          |
| `${pageCount}` / `${totalPages}` | Total page counts. Only available for PDF format.            |
| `${title}`                       | Article title, should be defined in [YAML Front Matter][yaml]. |
| `${author}`                      | Article author, defined in export options for PDF format, can be overwritten in [YAML Front Matter][yaml]. |
| Other variables                  | You can use `keyword: value` in [YAML Front Matter][yaml], then uses `${keyword}` variables in export configs. |

#### Unset Variables

For example, if in preferences panel, “Author” is configured, you can “unset” this by `author: '’` in yaml.
