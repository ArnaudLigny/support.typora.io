## Pre-conditions and Important Notes

To activate Typora, you will need to [purchase a license](https://store.typora.io/) first. After your purchase a license code will be sent to your email address, which you can use to activate Typora.

Activation **requires internet connection**, so you will need access to [store.typora.io](https://store.typora.io) to proceed with activation.

Once you have used a license code, you will need to use the **same email address** for future activations, so please make sure that you have entered a valid email address.

Activating Typora activates your account's copy of Typora on your current machine. If you switch to other accounts or other devices, you will need to activate Typora for those new accounts or devices. One license code can be used to activate a maximum of 3 devices at a time, and different accounts and operating systems on one machine are considered separate devices.

## Register / Activate Typora

You can activate Typora in the `License Panel`. On macOS, you can open the `License Panel` from the menu bar: `Typora` → `My license…`. On Windows / Linux, you can open the `License panel` from the menu bar: `Help` → `My license…`.

# FAQ

## How to retrieve my license code if I forgot it ?

One license key is sent to your email address after the purchase, so you could just search it in your mail box and check spam if you can not find it.

If you purchased Typora on our website (typora.io), then the license code is delivered via FastSpring, and you can find your orders and license code [here](https://typora.onfastspring.com/account) with the mail address you used for purchase. It will send you an login url to your mail box. If you do not receive it, please wait for a while and check your spam mails.

### Error message "Email address confirmation does not match"

### Error message "This license code has been used with a different email address."

At most 3 different devices, devices means different devices, different operation systems and VMs in one devices, different accounts in one operation system. 

## What if I have more than 3 devices?
