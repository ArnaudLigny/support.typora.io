You will have 15 days to evaluate Typora for free before purchasing a license code. If you're not satisfied with Typora for any reason, you will be able to get a full refund within 30 days from the license purchase.

## Why do I need to input my phone number?

You can refer [How to purchase multiple licenses?](#how-to-purchase-multiple-licenses-) to purchase the number of licenses you need. One license code can be used on at most 3 devices per user. If an user has more than 3 devices, you will need to buy extra licenses for them.

You will have a 15-day free trial before the purchase. If you use the dev version or the Linux version, you will have unlimited trial time if you keep Typora updated. However, we may show a "trial button", disable certain features or shorten trial time in the future, but most functions will be kept.
